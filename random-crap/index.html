<p> Hi im Syriana Marie Ambre Mbakob im going into cybersecurity.
 I love reading singing meeting people and just going through new experiences also im a total adrenaline junkie.
Im not married lol but I do have a family I love me and my four little sisters then my mom and dad and our dog and cat.
I think there are so many things I can learn in this course and im pretty excited for it im already learning things and thats a plus.
Ive been a member for a while I would say I dont have a favorite quote from our church exactly but i love serenity.
No favorite scripture but Ive really started loving everything in proverbs 31 i feel like theres a lot to learn about in there on being a
true virtuous women of god and how important it is to put in the work for that.</p>

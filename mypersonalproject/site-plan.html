        Welcome to my journey

      <p>
        A resume only tells part of the story... this is where you see the full picture. Beyond the Resume is my personal space to share the experiences, challenges, and passions that have shaped me. From the projects I’ve worked on to the lessons I’ve learned, this site goes deeper than just skills and job titles. Whether you're here to learn more about my journey, connect over shared interests, or see what drives me, I hope you find something that resonates.
      </p>
      <h3>
        Why?
      </h3>
      <p class="colored">
        Everyone has a story that goes beyond bullet points on a CV. I believe that who we are—the values we hold, the experiences that shaped us, and the passions that drive us matters just as much as what we do. This site is a reflection of that belief. Here, you’ll find a deeper look at my journey, from the projects I’ve worked on to the moments that have defined my path. It’s a space for authenticity, growth, and connection. So take a look around there’s more to the story than just a resume.
